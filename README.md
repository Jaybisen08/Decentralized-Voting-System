# Decentralized Voting System

## Project Description

The Decentralized Voting System is a blockchain-based smart contract solution built on Ethereum that enables secure, transparent, and tamper-proof elections. This system leverages the immutable nature of blockchain technology to ensure election integrity while maintaining voter privacy and providing real-time, verifiable results.

The smart contract eliminates the need for centralized authorities in managing elections, reducing the risk of manipulation and increasing trust in the democratic process. Every vote is recorded on the blockchain, creating an auditable trail that can be verified by anyone while maintaining the anonymity of individual voters.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to revolutionize the electoral process by creating a trustless, decentralized voting infrastructure that can be used for various types of elections - from small organizational decisions to large-scale governmental elections. We aim to increase voter confidence, reduce election costs, and ensure that every vote is counted accurately and transparently.

By leveraging blockchain technology, we envision a future where election fraud becomes virtually impossible, voter turnout increases due to improved accessibility, and the results can be trusted by all participants in the democratic process.

## Key Features

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- Truffle or Hardhat development environment
- MetaMask or similar Web3 wallet
- Ethereum testnet ETH for deployment

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd decentralized-voting-system

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Compile contracts
npx hardhat compile

# Deploy to testnet
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network goerli
```

### Usage
1. Deploy the contract with an election name
2. Register candidates using `addCandidate()`
3. Register eligible voters using `registerVoter()`
4. Start the election with `startVoting()`
5. Voters can cast their votes using `vote()`
6. End the election with `endVoting()`
7. View results using `getResults()`
